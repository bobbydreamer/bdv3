A sudden **Epiphany Moment** when i going through some technical blogs. 

Their sites are very simple, no jigna's(decorations). It was just a site with content, clean. 

So i started to think, do i have content for my beautiful site, answer was "No", at that moment. 

So whats the point, you do all the hardwork as before, insense, in 2007 i made my first site and hosted in bravehost.com it was full-fledged flash site. It was amazing, it had little content. Then in 2018, V2 of my site and it had only couple of content and i did not touch it afterwards. Now again it sort of looks like i am going to do the same thing. Well *"3 is a trend"*, so i decided to stop the designing part here. (PERIOD)

> Designer in me screamed, you cant take design out of you. You will still take screenshots, note down websites names, save the css, font names, those awesome colors, hexcodes, black spots in white background, how about little squares, diamonds, circles.....

**STOP**

##### New Plan 

1. Look for easy way to publish content on a site. Whats *Wordpress*, Whats a *static site generator*
1. Pick one 
1. Pick a theme which has tagging, table of contents, code highlights and mostly importantly easy to work with. 
1. Start making content 
1. Deploy it
1. Post contents every week. 

While going through the above list, 

1. Started looking into Hugo, Jerkyll, 11ty and Gatsby
1. Picked Gatsby, it was fast. 
1. There were many themes, picked the one that had tagging, dark mode and code highlighter. [Gatsby Starter: Minimal Blog](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog)
1. Started adding some content in development 
1. Gatsby support Firebase Hosting ( Hurray, i know that one )

Trying to break the trend here. Lets see how this goes.
