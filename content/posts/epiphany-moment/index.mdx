A sudden **Epiphany Moment** when i going through some technical blogs. 

Their sites are very simple, nothing fancy, no jignas, just plain simple content on what they did and doing. 

So i started to think, do i have content for my beautiful site, answer was "No", at that moment. So whats the point, you are experimenting design/colors/effects, you can have a page separately for it. But if you do all the hardwork on getting a site up with all the fancies and after sometime, you don't add any content or anything, whats the point. This has happened earlier in 2007, first site, fully Adobe flash enabled, worked on it for 6months and later did not even visit the site. Second site, in 2018, worked on it for almost again 6months, this time added couple of contents and later got busy with life and adding content in this site is pretty tedious as its .html . Now am i doing it all over again, could be. I dont want to prove "*3 is a trend*", so decided to stop designing part here. (PERIOD)

Still i will collect templates, notedown website names, css effects, font names, color codes, palettes, but focus would be more on the content as i am really bad at writing, i am going to improve that. 

##### New Plan 

1. Look for easy way to publish content on a site. Whats *Wordpress*, Whats a *static site generator*
1. Pick one 
1. Pick a theme which has tagging, table of contents, code highlights and mostly importantly easy to work with. 
1. Start making content 
1. Deploy it
1. Post contents every week. 

While going through the above list, 

1. Started looking into Hugo, Jerkyll, 11ty and Gatsby
1. Picked Gatsby, its fast. 
1. There were many themes, picked the one that had tagging, dark mode and code highlighter. [Gatsby Starter: Minimal Blog](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog)
1. Started adding content in development and experimenting gatsby
1. Gatsby supports Firebase Hosting ( Fantastic, so deployment will be bit easy for me )

Mostly i am trying to break the trend here. Lets see how this goes.
