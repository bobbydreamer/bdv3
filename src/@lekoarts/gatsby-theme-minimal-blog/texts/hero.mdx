<h3>Hello, I'am Sushanth.</h3>

I am a mainframe Db2 DBA. 

Yep, mainframe is still there and as usual its highly scalable, highly available and highly secured. 
Occasionally, Tom Cruise tries to visit us from ceiling, we just look up and say "Hi Tom" and he just panics and says "Code red, mission compromised" and he does his trailer-shot run. :D

This site is my sandbox, probably will contain collection of my unorganized notes/articles, programming tests, home projects, fav. music, fav. YT videos and VLC screenshots not sure why i take those, mostly stuff i took time to look at.
