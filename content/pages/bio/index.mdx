Hi!

I am a Db2 DBA on z/OS platform with over nine years of work-experience living in Chennai. I specialise in reviewing Complex SQLs, accesspaths & setting up Queue Replication in Db2 and well versed with Rexx scripts in automating repeatative tedious tasks.

I'm an enthusiastic, self-driven and passionate database administrator/programmer who enjoys learning new technologies and see if its applicable to current work or it is something i should adopt to. This website itself is sort of like a self challenge to know whether i am still good at web-designing AND use this site to test some of my HOME Projects.

To know more about me, have a look at my  resume
