Learnt the below technique in python to show the line which caused the exception. By default, when you handle exception, it doesn't show the line number. Now, adding this to all my programs.
```py {6}
    try : 

    except Exception as e:
        print('Failed due to error')        
        print('Exception : ',e)
        print(traceback.format_exc())
```

Problem being a computer programmer is, your life is so perfect(you think), so you create a problem for yourself and work on solving that problem. It gives a good feeling when you solve it. But its entirely waste of time at some point you might wonder. Problem never existed.

**Jupyter Notebook** - Previously when i try to write a program, i also create lots of small programs to test features, functionality, understanding concepts and finally implement them in the big program with Notebook everthing can be done in one big place and tests go really cluttered and its everywhere, eventually i spend lot of time in deleting cells which should have been in a separate program, as i wrote that for testing and understanding purposes. 

Have to learn a approach to avoid this.
